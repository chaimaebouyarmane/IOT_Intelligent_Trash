# Smart Trash IoT Project 🗑️

In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, the Internet of Things (IoT) is at the forefront of innovation, bringing about significant changes in the way we interact with everyday objects. The Smart Trash project is a prime example of how IoT is reshaping our lives. By harnessing the power of sensors, microcontrollers, and mobile interfaces, this project tackles common issues with a fresh and intelligent approach. With features like automatic lid opening, fill-level detection to prevent overflows, and real-time notifications for immediate trash collection, it exemplifies the pivotal role IoT plays in enhancing efficiency, reducing waste, and simplifying our daily routines.

## Features 📋

🚀 **Automatic Lid Opening:** The trash can opens automatically when someone approaches it, thanks to a motion sensor.

📏 **Fill Level Sensor:** The trash can detects its fill level and prevents opening if it's full, avoiding overflows.

📢 **Notification System:** When the trash can is full, a notification system sends an alert for immediate collection.

## Hardware Used 🛠️

- Microcontroller: ESP32
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- Servo Motor: SG90
- Breadboard
- Dupont Wire Combination For Arduino

## Software Used 📡

- Arduino IDE
- Blynk Platform (for the mobile user interface)

### Blynk Mobile App Interface 📱

To remotely interact with the Smart Trash Can project, we've established a user-friendly mobile interface through the Blynk platform. That include a notification feature to alert waste collection personnel when the trash can reaches full capacity.

## Setup and Installation 🏗️

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-trash-can.git


1- Open the Arduino IDE and load the Arduino sketch from the arduino directory.

2- Configure the necessary libraries and dependencies.

3- Upload the sketch to your ESP32 microcontroller.

4- Set up the Blynk mobile app to interact with your trash can (provide configuration details).

## Usage 📦

+ Power on your Smart Trash Can.
+ Approach the trash can to trigger automatic lid opening.
+ The fill level sensor will prevent lid opening when the trash can is full.
+ When the trash can is full, the notification system will alert you for immediate collection.
