# Smart Trash Can IoT Project 🗑️

![Smart Trash Can](link_to_your_project_image.png)

Welcome to the Smart Trash Can IoT project repository! This project aims to create an intelligent trash can with the following features:

🚀 **Automatic Lid Opening:** The trash can opens automatically when someone approaches it, thanks to a motion sensor.
📏 **Fill Level Sensor:** The trash can detects its fill level and prevents opening if it's full, avoiding overflows.
📢 **Notification System:** When the trash can is full, a notification system sends an alert for immediate collection.
