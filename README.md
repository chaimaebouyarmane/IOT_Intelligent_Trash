In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, the Internet of Things (IoT) is at the forefront of innovation, bringing about significant changes in the way we interact with everyday objects. The Smart Trash project is a prime example of how IoT is reshaping our lives. By harnessing the power of sensors, microcontrollers, and mobile interfaces, this project tackles common issues with a fresh and intelligent approach. With features like automatic lid opening, fill-level detection to prevent overflows, and real-time notifications for immediate trash collection, it exemplifies the pivotal role IoT plays in enhancing efficiency, reducing waste, and simplifying our daily routines.


Welcome to the Smart Trash Can IoT project repository! This project aims to create an intelligent trash can with the following features:

🚀 **Automatic Lid Opening:** The trash can opens automatically when someone approaches it, thanks to a motion sensor.
📏 **Fill Level Sensor:** The trash can detects its fill level and prevents opening if it's full, avoiding overflows.
📢 **Notification System:** When the trash can is full, a notification system sends an alert for immediate collection.
